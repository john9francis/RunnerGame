# Overview

This is my game, "Punk Run." Dodge the obstacles by jumping with the spacebar and moving around with the A and right D. 

This is a simple runner game coded using the MonoGame framework. I created this game to demonstrate how MonoGame works for a simple video game.

This game demonstrates the following:

* User input to move a player
* Movement of non player objects
* Simple colission detection
* Display of text on the screen
* Use of sound effects
* Different game screens/ game states (Main menu, Gameplay, Game over)
